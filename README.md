# EGT 309 Project: EDA and ML pipeline

## Project Description

### Synopsis 
This project is part of the EGT309 Learning Unit and contributes 40% to the final grade. It involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), building a machine learning pipeline, and presenting insights and model performance.

### Objectives
1) Perform EDA and document insights
2) Select and justify machine learning models
3) Build and execute a machine learning pipeline
4) Collaborate using version control
5) Present and explain code and results effectively
